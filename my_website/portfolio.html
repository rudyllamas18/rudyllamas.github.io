    <h4>The purpose of my game was to shoot all the aliens and dodge the lazers.<br> I worked on the shooting and space bar aspect while<br> my group partner worked on the movment part of things.<br> He seperated the movement into 3 diffrent levels<br> and to adjust to this i had to change my code and<br> separate it into 3 diffrent blocks of code with diffrent <br>firing patterns as well. We had trouble getting the movment right <br> and in the end i think that scratch gets really buggy if you put <br>in to many scripts like me and my partner did. Next time we shoudl focus on making the code more simple in order to save proccessing power.</h4>
