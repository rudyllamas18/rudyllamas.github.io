    <h2>Bad Space invaders clone</h2>
    <h4>The purpose of my game was to shoot all the aliens and dodge the lazers.<br> I worked on the shooting and space bar aspect while<br> my group partner worked on the movment part of things.<br> He seperated the movement into 3 diffrent levels<br> and to adjust to this i had to change my code and<br> separate it into 3 diffrent blocks of code with diffrent <br>firing patterns as well. We had trouble getting the movment right <br> and in the end i think that scratch gets really buggy if you put <br>in to many scripts like me and my partner did. Next time we shoudl focus on making the code more simple in order to save proccessing power.</h4>

    <h2>Stranded</h2>
    <p>After being ship wrecked you are stranded, alone on an uncharted island. With nothing but your knife and your witts you will try to survive and make it back to civilization. In order to make this story I first made a tree map of the diffrent paths you could take. After I used the basic commands of python like def, if, elif ect. The only problems that we encountred where when adding in the ascci pictures. I'm very happy with how it turned out. I really liked, the life of phuc and the party. The life of Phuc had good humor and never failed to enterntain through every choice. The party had a much more serious tone but it was programed really well and hope to make something similar next time.</p>
